                <p><b>Scope</b></p>
                <p>Before we start creating, we set the project scope. We discuss ideas of what we’d like to include in the Brand Guide. Since this is the first brand guide, we decided to start small and scale up later if we’d like to add more content. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>These <b>4 categories</b> were chosen for the Brand Guide outline:</p>
                <ul class="ic">
                    <li>Tone of voice</li>
                    <li>Logo</li>
                    <li>Color</li>
                    <li>Typography</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><b>Discovery</b></p>
                <p>We conducted a survey of the community leaders to learn their visions during the beginning of the discovery phase. This survey and the followup interview became our blueprint.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We researched other design communities and how they position their brand. We went through multiple brand guides to learn style, organization, content and layout. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Using Pinterest we made Moodboard to explore the design style. First, designers collected images and colors that were inspirational to the brand design. Then, we went through the collection visuals and discussed the design direction to make sure we are on the same page before moving on to the creation stage.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Moodboard and its discussion lead the direction of inclusive, gender neutral, plus fun and magical feel. This is because community members are various ages, mixed genders and from different backgrounds. We'd like everyone to feel welcomed through the brand. 
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <p><b>Creation</b></p>
                <p>A group of Designers and UX writers took responsibility for each category and created a draft. Then the draft was then reviewed with the team and stakeholders. According to the feedback, multiple iterations were made. After each section was completed, we consolidated the categories into one layout and finalized it. </p>

                <h2><mark>Brand Guide Categories</mark></h2>
                <p>We had 4 band guild categories, I was in charge of 2 of the categories, Logo and Colors. In separate documents I cover these sections in detail below. I highlight the major process in the 2 other categories Tone of voice and Typography. You can also view the finished brand guild here.

                <br>
                <p><b>Logo</b></p>
                <p>We decided to update the logo along with creating a Brand Guide. The original logo had been used over a year and the drastic brand renewal has a risk that people may not recognize as the same community. We need to consider updating the logo's meaning and how the logo retains the same community feel. </p><br>
                <p>Our goal is to simplify the current logo for the use of multiple occasions and make it more gender neutral. </p><br>
                <p>To achieve the goal, these 3 things apply to new designs.
                </p>
                <ul class="ic">
                    <li>use wizard hat to be main element</li>
                    <li>keep original logo’s font, outline frame, cursor element and color
                    </li>
                    <li>use hand drawing lines to keep a crafty feel
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Our original plan is to keep the original Turquoise color, however, Turquoise + white doesn’t have enough contrast and didn’t pass the accessibility test. We decided to adopt a new brand color navy to the new logo color.

                <p><b>Color</b></p>
                <p>Our vision of color palette is playful, magical and fun. The team was towards having turquoise and purple colors on the color palette during the discovery phase. Turquoise is from the original logo color and the purple has a magical feel. I carried the idea and started testing the color combination. After the overall color palette is set, start refining to finding the right balance and tone of the color palette. At the final stage, I tested the colors with illustrations to visualize the color usage, and balance to see how it could change the feel. Neutral colors, navy, white and light purple are added to unify diverse color palettes. Accent colors, red and yellow spice up the graphic. </p>

                <br><br>
                <p><b>Tone of voice</b></p>
                <p>We conducted the survey to the community leaders and asked questions that included a mission statement and words to describe the community. The UX writers consolidate the answers, follow up to the community leaders to learn more details about their visions. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>During the process of creating the Tone of Voice category, we found we needed to make 2 new sections <b>Mission</b> and <b>Who We Are</b>before diving into <b>Tone of Voice </b>because knowing that the community's goals are for enthusiasts with a focus on learning means we wanted to use a more playful tone. Multiple content iterations had been made before launching. </p>
                <br><br>
                <p><b>Typography</b></p>
                <p>We chose our fonts using 2 criteria, font legibility, and if the font had a good selection of styles and weights. We explored the typography options and the font combinations by selecting a set of fonts. With each font we styled a sample paragraph including a header, body and button. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After testing all the fonts, the team chose the Overpass. This font has a good selection of weights and is great for both headers and body text. We also felt a connection with this font because the Overpass font is used in road signals all around America which tie into UX Wizard’s ever-expand reach. </p>
